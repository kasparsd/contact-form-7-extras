Simple controls, analytics, tracking and redirects for Contact Form 7.


## Description

**NEW:** Subscribe to the [ðŸš€ PRO version](https://formcontrols.com/pro) for advanced analytics and tracking features, and professional support by the plugin author.

This is an addon for the [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) plugin with the following features:

- [Track form submissions, errors and completions](https://formcontrols.com/docs) with Google Analytics (GA4), Google Tag (gtag.js), Google Tag Manager (GTM), Matomo (formerly Piwik) and Facebook Pixel.
- Redirect to URL on form submission
- Disable AJAX form submissions
- Disable default form CSS
- Disable automatic paragraph formatting
- Disable HTML5 input field types or enable the HTML5 input type fallback
- Specify the Google reCAPTCHA language

Please note that some settings work on the per-page level and will apply to all forms on the same page. For example, disabling AJAX form submissions for one form will disable AJAX submissions on all forms on the same page.

### Requirements

- [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) version 4.3 or later for features related to submission tracking and redirects.

### Usage

The plugin adds a new "Customize" tab for each Contact Form 7 form in the WordPress administration area.

### Analytics Tracking

The plugin _automatically_ triggers analytics events for the following services:

- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) and [Global Site Tag (gtag.js)](https://developers.google.com/gtagjs) with `ga()`, `_gaq.push()` and `dataLayer.push()` implementations,
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) (formerly Piwik),
- [Facebook Pixel Conversion Tracking](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking).

It passes the following data with the event:

- "Contact Form" as the event category,
- "Submit", "Sent", "Error" or "Spam" as the event action, and
- the form title as the event title.

#### Facebook Pixel

The [standard Contact event](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#standard-events) is used for Facebook Pixel with `content_category` property set to the event type (Submit, Sent, Error, Spam) and `content_name` set to the form title.
