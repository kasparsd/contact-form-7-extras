Simple controls, analytics, tracking and redirects for Contact Form 7.


## Description

This plugin enables simple controls for some of the advanced features of the [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) plugin:

- Track form submissions, errors and completions [with Google Analytics, Matomo (formerly Piwik) and Facebook Pixel](https://formcontrols.com/docs).
- Redirect to URL on form submission
- Disable AJAX form submissions
- Disable default form CSS
- Disable automatic paragraph formatting
- Disable HTML5 input field types or enable the HTML5 input type fallback
- Specify the Google Recaptcha language

Please note that some settings work on per-page level and will inherit for all forms on the same page. For example, disabling AJAX form submissions for one form will disable AJAX submissions on all forms on the same page.

**Visit the [official plugin homepage â†’](https://formcontrols.com)**

### Requirements

- [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) version 4.3 or later for features related to submission tracking and redirects.

### Usage

The plugin adds a new "Customize" tab for each Contact Form 7 form in the WordPress administration area.

### Analytics Tracking

The plugin automatically triggers analytics events for the following services:

- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/) with `ga()`, `_gaq.push()` and `dataLayer.push()` implementations,
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org/) (formerly Piwik),
- [Facebook Pixel Conversion Tracking](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking).

It passes the following data with the event:

- "Contact Form" as the event category,
- "Submit", "Sent", "Error" or "Spam" as the event action, and
- the form title as the event title.

#### Facebook Pixel

The [standard Contact event](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-pixel/implementation/conversion-tracking#standard-events) is used for Facebook Pixel with `content_category` property set to the event type (Submit, Sent, Error, Spam) and `content_name` set to the form title.
