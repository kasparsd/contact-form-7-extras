Simple controls for some of the advanced Contact Form 7 plugin functionality.


## Description

This plugin enables simple controls for some of the advanced features of the [Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) plugin:

- Disable AJAX form submissions
- Disable default form CSS
- Disable automatic paragraph formatting
- Disable HTML5 input field types or enable the HTML5 input type fallback
- Track form submissions, errors and completions with Google Analytics and Matomo (formerly Piwik)
- Redirect to URL on form submission
- Specify the Google Recaptcha language

Please note that some settings work on per-page level and will inherit for all forms on the same page. For example, disabling AJAX form submissions for one form will disable AJAX submissions on all forms on the same page.
